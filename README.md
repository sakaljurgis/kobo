# kobo
work in progress.

it is intended for 2 things:
1. web articles in epub format. (sort of implemented)
   1. using your pc's (or phone's) web browser, add article's url to this web server.
   2. it will download the article (and images) and convert it to epub
   3. you can download the epub file using kobo device.
2. search and download your epubs from kobo device's web browser. (not implemented yet)

### why?
- pocket is great and natively supported by kobo, but it doesn't save images (at least not for the tried articles).
- wallabag is also great, but it doesn't have a native kobo app so you need koreader.
